          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>Canadian Diaper Pricer was created to help Canadian parents find the best diaper deals from Canadian retailers. Our mission is to make it easy to compare diaper prices in one place, saving you both time and money.</p>
          <p>As parents ourselves, we understand how quickly diaper costs add up. With constantly fluctuating prices across different retailers, it can be challenging to know where to find the best deals. Our website solves this problem by providing real-time price comparisons.</p>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h3>How It Works</h3>
          <p>We regularly collect pricing data from major Canadian retailers including Amazon.ca, Walmart Canada, Well.ca, Canadian Tire, Costco Canada, Real Canadian Superstore, Shoppers Drug Mart, and more.</p>
          <p>Our system calculates the price per diaper for each listing, making it easy to compare value across different package sizes and brands. This way, you can quickly see which retailer offers the best value for your preferred diaper brand and size.</p>
